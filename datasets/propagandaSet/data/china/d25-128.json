    "Notes": "A two-part series detailing the counterrevolutionary activities and \"crimes\" perpetrated by the Roman Catholic Mission in China before and after 1949. Both series are incomplete: the first part lacks the opening sheets; the second part lacks at least one sheet, and possibly more at the end.Due to this, it is impossible to indicate when the series were published, where, by whom, and for what specific purpose. The last evil deed discussed, at the end of part two, dates from July 1965, during the \"Four Clean Ups\" movement (四清运动). This suggests that the two series were published some time in the mid-1960s.The names of the foreign missionaries have been identified as far as possibile.The poster preceding this one (2022) is missing. We therefore do not know anything about Ren Yuru (任玉如, a Chinese priest) serving at Datong Theological Seminary, a religious school located in Datong, Shanxi Province. After the Belgian dean and the Belgian professors teaching at the college were arrested by the Japanese invaders and later imprisoned in Shandong, Ren took over.The photographs show seized counter-revolutionary documents and publications; ledgers showing that Ren Yuru embezzled money.",
