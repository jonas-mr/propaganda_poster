    "Notes": "The Beijing Municipal Scrap Recycling Company calls on people to hand over as much scrap metal and other waste materials as possible. The structure of the image, with its triumvirate of a worker, peasant and soldier, clearly date it to the Cultural Revolution period; so do the slogan on top, a Mao Zedong quote that reads \"Prepare for struggle, prepare for famine, for the people\", and the copies of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong that the worker and peasant hold up. The poster explains how the junk that has been handed in saves virgin resources (\"Every 10 tons of scrap iron produces nine tons of good iron\") and energy to produce plows, mini-vans and bicycles.",
