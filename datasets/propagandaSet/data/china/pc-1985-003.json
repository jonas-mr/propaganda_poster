    "Notes": "A public garden on Chengdu's main square, with a group of schoolchildren on a drawing excursion and residents enjoying their leisure time. The location is Tianfu Square (天府广场), with the Sichuan Science and Technology Museum in the background on the left. Perhaps the most striking aspect of this peaceful picture: right in front of the museum is a giant Mao statue, one of the few left standing after 1976, and the most prominent object on the square. It is deliberately kept just out of view!",
