    "Notes": "This poster, published by the Liaoning Old and Used Goods Collection Company, shows how old leather shoes are turned into artificial fertilizer. Producing inputs to increase agricultural production fitted with the prevailing developmental strategy to facilitate industrialization. The image focus on leather shoes is remarkable: most Chinese at the time would have worn cloth shoes. It can be argued that in those days of increasing revolutionary fervor, owning leather shoes might incur suspicions of belonging to the capitalist class. What better way than exonerating oneself than by donating these aspects of class distinction to the revolution?",
