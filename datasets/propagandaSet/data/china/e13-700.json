    "Notes": "This poster was designed to accompany a drive to persuade people to purchase bonds during the \"Economic Construction Period\" which started in December 1953. Ostensibly well-to-do urbanites and private businessmen were urged to subscribe from January to March 1954, and to hand over their ample savings to the government in order to contribute to national reconstruction. The sign on the left identifies the receiving party as the \"National Economic Reconstruction Bonds Subscription Office\".",
