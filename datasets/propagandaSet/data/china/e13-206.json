    "Notes": "Deng Xiaoping is the main architect of the economic reforms. He abolishes the idolization of political leaders; during his lifetime, his portrait appears on posters only very rarely. This Deng-quotation is illustrated with a photograph of a flower arrangement.The full quotation, from a speech during Deng's 1992 Southern Tour:要坚持党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策，关键是坚持“一个中心，两个基本点”。不坚持社会主义，不改革开放，不发展经济，不改善人民生活，只能是死路一条。基本路线要管一百年，动摇不得。In upholding the line, principles and policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the CPC, it is essential to adhere to the principle of \"one central task and two basic points\". If we did not adhere to socialism, implement the policies of reform and opening to the outside world, develop the economy and raise living standards, we would find ourselves in a blind alley. We should adhere to the basic line for a hundred years, with no vacillation. (translation: https://dengxiaopingworks.wordpress.com)",
