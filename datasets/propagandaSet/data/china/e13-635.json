The work was overseen closely by Zhou Enlai. Although photographs of Mao seemingly taking part in the digging exist, it is unclear how much work he actually contributed. One of the more famous of these photographs had Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen, standing behind Mao, airbrushed out during the Cultural Revolution.",
