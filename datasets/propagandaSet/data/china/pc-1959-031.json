They are obviously showing off, overtaking the young peasants, and attract the attention of the women. The two younger women closest to them, have a whispered conversation and cast admiring glances... Romantic encounters between women and men are extremely rare in Chinese propaganda posters; another example is His laboring work is the best, from 1953.Wu Min created the image, Lin Ximing the papercut frame.",
