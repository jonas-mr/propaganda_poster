    "Notes": "Most of the cartoons of a set of 20 posters, published during the anti-Hu Feng movement, cannot be linked to any of the 17 designers mentioned on the opening sheet. This 11th one, however, has been signed by Te Wei (top left corner).Hu Feng directs his \"Hu Feng Clique\" like a high priest; the pennant behind him bears the text \"Counter-revolution\", the panel in front of him \"subjective idealism\". The smaller pennants read, o.a., \"rumors\" and \"heresies\".",
