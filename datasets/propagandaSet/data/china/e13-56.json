This peasant painting \"expresses a cheerful and imaginative mood with flying spring swallows\" (Li Fenglan said), received the guidance of famous painters such as Liu Wenxi, and was finalized after many artistic processes. In 1972, it was exhibited in Beijing and became an instant hit. It has become one of the representative works of Huxian peasant paintings and Li Fenglan herself, and has gained a high reputation.",
