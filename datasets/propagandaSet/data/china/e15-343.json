    "Notes": "Zhao Chun'e (1935-1982) was a model worker from Luoyang. She joined work in 1958, worked as a boiler worker in the Luoyang Paper Mill, worked as a temporary worker in the old coal yard in 1966, and became a full-time worker in 1971. She was known as the \"doer who can't stay idle\", enthusiastically taking care of widows, elderly, and military martyrs; influencing and helping the healthy growth of the younger generation.Luan Fu was originally a talented student from Taipei University. He was wanted by the Guomindang for drawing cartoons satirizing Chiang Kai-shek's regime, so in 1949, he smuggled himself on a freighter from Taiwan to the mainland to join the revolution. He was sent to Shanxi University to continue his studies and stayed to teach after graduation. He taught 13 courses and translated books in 15 languages. Because he came from Taiwan, he always said that he was a spy, but there was no place to check. He became a \"veteran athlete\" in successive political campaigns. He developed cancer as a result of injuries sustained during criticism campaigns.",
