    "Notes": "A two-part series detailing the counterrevolutionary activities and \"crimes\" perpetrated by the Roman Catholic Mission in China before and after 1949. Both series are incomplete: the first part lacks the opening sheets; the second part lacks at least one sheet, and possibly more at the end.Due to this, it is impossible to indicate when the series were published, where, by whom, and for what specific purpose. The last evil deed discussed, at the end of part two, dates from July 1965, during the \"Four Clean Ups\" movement (四清运动). This suggests that the two series were published some time in the mid-1960s.The names of the foreign missionaries have been identified as far as possibile.The text reads \"Part TwoCrimes of the Counter-Revolutionary Restorationist Activities of the Catholic Church after LiberationUnder the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people carried out a long, arduous and heroic struggle and finally defeated the three major enemies of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucracy and gained liberation. However, the imperialists and the defeated reactionary classes in the country were not willing to accept their defeat. They carried out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities rampantly and attempted counter-revolutionary restoration. Catholicism is their tool for carrying out this evil activity. The following is some evidence of the Catholic Church’s counter-revolutionary restoration activities.\"",
