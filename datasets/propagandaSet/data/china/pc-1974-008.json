Although published a year later than the 1973 version reprinted again and again, it looks less sophisticated in details and color - as if this is an earlier version not yet 'improved' by a professional artist?Designer Dong Zhengyi is identified in the imprint as \"member of the suburban commune of Huxian County, Shaanxi Province\" (陕西省户县城郊公社社员董正谊).",
