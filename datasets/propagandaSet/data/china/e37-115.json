Construction of the railway started in May 1946, but by 1949 only 13% of the total project was completed. After the founding of the PRC, the railway resumed work in April 1950, was opened to traffic in October 1952, and was delivered for operation in August 1954. It was transformed into an electrified railway in 1984. In 2000, a double-track reconstruction was carried out and it was put into operation in 2003.",
