    "Notes": "\"Destructive earthquake emergency response propaganda charts\" (破坏性应急宣传挂图) is a 12-poster series published in 1995. The set is bilingual: Chinese and Arabic.The poster shows an ancient seismoscope, as developed by Zhang Heng (78-139 CE) in 132 CE. It recorded the motions of Earth's shaking, but unlike a seismometer, it did not retain a time record of those motions. It was named \"earthquake weathervane\" (hòufēng dìdòngyí 候風地動儀), and it was able to roughly determine the direction (out of eight directions) where the earthquake came from. Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose.The text on top reads \"Earthquake emergency plan in advanceStay calm in the face of earthquakes, be prepared and resist at the same timeGovernment leadership social mobilizationEfficient and orderly disaster reduction and avoidance\" (地震应急 预案在先 -- 临震不乱 防抗并然 -- 政府领导 社会动员 -- 高效有序 减灾避险).The title of the book the man is holding is \"Destructive earthquake emergency regulations\" (破坏性地震应急条例).",
