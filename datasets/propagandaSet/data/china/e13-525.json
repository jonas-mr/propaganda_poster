    "Notes": "\"Famous people, famous words\" is an educational series from 1996, presenting a number of famous persons, both Chinese and foreign, and their famous utterances. This is a 1956 quote from Mao Zedong ('Xuxin shi ren jinbu, jiao'ao shi ren luohuo, women yingdang yongyuan jizhu zhege zhenli' 虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理), \"Modesty leads to progress, conceit makes one lag behind, we must always remember this truth\"). In 1956, Mao was going to make a closing speech at the Eighth National CCP Congress. He was not satisfied with the speech provided by Chen Boda. He asked his secretary Tian Jiaying to come up with an alternative. Mao read out Tian's speech, which included this phrase, without going over it beforehand, to thunderous applause.",
