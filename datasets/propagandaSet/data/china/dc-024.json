    "Notes": "Preliminary design for a poster that was not published - after the events of 4 June 1989 it was not deemed appropriate. This design was shown to us in the late 1990s during a visit to a major poster publishing house. Together with two other preliminary designs, it was hidden under a carpet and brought out almost furtively - although we were allowed to take a photograph. See also DC-025 and DC-026.",
