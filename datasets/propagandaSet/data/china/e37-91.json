The formulation process took place in the second half of 1955.

Subsequently, under the chairmanship of Mao Zedong, the \"Seventeen Articles\" were expanded into the \"National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 (Draft)\", which was submitted to the Supreme State Council for discussion by the Political Bureau of the CCP on January 23, 1956 and then announced.With eight posters in the collection, the set is incomplete: provisions 35-40 are missing.Provisions 1-5.1: All provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions are required to basically complete the primary form of agricultural co-operation in 19562: Areas with a good foundation for cooperation and where a number of high-level cooperatives have already been established are to basically complete high-level agricultural cooperativization in 19573: Agricultural production cooperatives should make appropriate arrangements in production and life for widowed farmers and disabled soldiers4: The problem of former landlords and rich peasants who have given up exploitation should begin to be resolved within 19565: Counterrevolutionary elements in rural areas should be dealt with",
