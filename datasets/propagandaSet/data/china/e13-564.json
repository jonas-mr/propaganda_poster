There the text is translated as:This poster depicts a heroic fighter who, having been seriously wounded in the head in battle against the aggressors, brushes aside medical assistance and, gun in hand, charges the enemy in defence of Chairman Mao and the motherland. The burning hatred in his eyes and his forceful motion as he dashes towards the invaders fully express the heroic resolve of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army to vanquish all enemies and its thoroughgoing revolutionary spirit of “fearing neither hardship nor death”.",
