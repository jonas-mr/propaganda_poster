    "Notes": "A two-part series detailing the counterrevolutionary activities and \"crimes\" perpetrated by the Roman Catholic Mission in China before and after 1949. Both series are incomplete: the first part lacks the opening sheets; the second part lacks at least one sheet, and possibly more at the end.Due to this, it is impossible to indicate when the series were published, where, by whom, and for what specific purpose. The last evil deed discussed, at the end of part two, dates from July 1965, during the \"Four Clean Ups\" movement (四清运动). This suggests that the two series were published some time in the mid-1960s.The names of the foreign missionaries have been identified as far as possibile.The photographs show the arrest of Gong Pinmei on 8 September 1955; partially burned US and GMD paraphernalia; handwritten confessions by Gong Pinmei (note that the confession is dated 9 May 1958!).",
