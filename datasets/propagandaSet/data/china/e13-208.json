    "Notes": "Deng Xiaoping is the main architect of the economic reforms. He abolishes the idolization of political leaders; during his lifetime, his portrait appears on posters only very rarely. This Deng-quotation is illustrated with a photograph of a modern cityscape.The full quotation, from a speech during Deng's 1992 Southern Tour:没有一点闯的精神，没有一点‘冒’的精神，没有一股气呀、劲呀，就走不出一条好路，走不出一条新路，就干不出新的事业.If we don’t have the pioneering spirit, if we’re afraid to take risks, if we have no energy and drive, we cannot break a new path, a good path, or accomplish anything new.
