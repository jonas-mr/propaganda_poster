This poster shows the determination and fanaticism with which children re-enact an event in which somebody is called to account for spreading counterrevolutionary publications, scattered on the floor. Judging by the looks of the two grown-ups, this is clearly no laughing matter. The slogan on the wall reads \"Struggle to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat!\"",
