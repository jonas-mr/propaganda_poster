    "Notes": "A two-part series detailing the counterrevolutionary activities and \"crimes\" perpetrated by the Roman Catholic Mission in China before and after 1949. Both series are incomplete: the first part lacks the opening sheets; the second part lacks at least one sheet, and possibly more at the end.Due to this, it is impossible to indicate when the series were published, where, by whom, and for what specific purpose. The last evil deed discussed, at the end of part two, dates from July 1965, during the \"Four Clean Ups\" movement (四清运动). This suggests that the two series were published some time in the mid-1960s.The names of the foreign missionaries have been identified as far as possibile.Titled \"Evidence of the crimes of the imperialist missionaries Ge Lugao and Bian Jining\" (帝国主义传教士葛露膏，边寄宁的罪证), it introduces Ge Lugao (葛露膏, no further details known) and Bian Jining (边寄宁, identified as priest); both were active in Xi'an.Ge and Bian were arrested in 1950 for spreading rumours, hiding weapons, plotting counter revolutionary activities with GMD secret agents. They were xpelled in November 1951.The photographs show wireless radio equipment hidden behind paintings; radio messages; more wireless radio equipment.",
