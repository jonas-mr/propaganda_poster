In the early 1940s the text was rewritten again, to become a hymn to Mao Zedong:\"The east is red, the sun is risingChina has brought forth a Mao Zedong.He works for the people's welfare.Hurrah, He is the people's great savior.\"A so-called 'song-and-dance epic' was made around it in the early 1960s, in 1965 a film version was released.During the Cultural Revolution the song was played everywhere, all the time, and in fact replaced the official anthem of the People's Republic.",
