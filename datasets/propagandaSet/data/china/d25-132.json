    "Notes": "A two-part series detailing the counterrevolutionary activities and \"crimes\" perpetrated by the Roman Catholic Mission in China before and after 1949. Both series are incomplete: the first part lacks the opening sheets; the second part lacks at least one sheet, and possibly more at the end.Due to this, it is impossible to indicate when the series were published, where, by whom, and for what specific purpose. The last evil deed discussed, at the end of part two, dates from July 1965, during the \"Four Clean Ups\" movement (四清运动). This suggests that the two series were published some time in the mid-1960s.The names of the foreign missionaries have been identified as far as possibile.The cartoon shows Li having the the church bells rung, calling up the believers, thereby obstructing the Four Clean Ups workteams from interviewing the vilagers. The photographs show Investigator Zhang Yuchun reporting on Li Zhixiu's counterrevolutionary crimes during a mass meeting. Zhang Gen, a follower, accusing Li.",
