    "Notes": "Most of the cartoons of a set of 20 posters, published during the anti-Hu Feng movement, cannot be linked to any of the 17 designers mentioned on the opening sheet.Although this fifth poster is dated and signed, the signature is hard to decipher. The left panel shows Hu Feng as a border guard, blocking access to the liberated areas, with a pen with the phrase \"Life is everwhere\" (到处有生活, Daochu you shenghuo) serving as a barrier. The right panel shows a Guomindang soldier similarly blocking access, using a gun with a bayonet.",
