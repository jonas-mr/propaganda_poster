But the enemy threw bombs and fired rockets and blocked the surface of the river. Regardless of everything, Ruan Shizhuo bravely paddled the boat amidst the heavy fire. She brought one soldier after another to the other side of the river. She said: 'I am old and cannot hold a rifle, but I can contribute my part to the revolution'.\"",
