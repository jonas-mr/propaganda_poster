    "Notes": "The \"Charter of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company\" was formulated in 1960 and endorsed by Mao Zedong that same year. It summarized a set of basic experiences of enterprise management at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company (鞍山钢铁公司). The basic contents consisted of \"two participations, one reform and three-in-one unity\" (cadres participating in labor, workers participating in management, reforming unreasonable rules and regulations, and the three-in-one combination of workers, leading cadres and technicians). In its implementation, however, the essence of the \"Angang Charter\" was the leadership of the Party Committee, putting the secretary in command. Mao's endorsement (which can be found here) was republished in 1977 to bolster Hua Guofeng's reform attempts. The consistent calls to emulate Daqing can be seen on the banner (\"Study the Daqing spirit, follow the Daqing course, create Daqing-like industries\").",
