It provided that there would be only one China, but that regions (Hong Kong, Macau) could retain their own economic and administrative systems, while the rest of mainland China uses socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the principle, each region could continue to have its own governmental system, legal, economic and financial affairs, including trade relations with foreign countries, all of which are independent from those of the mainland. The PRC has also proposed to apply the principle in the unification it aims for with Taiwan.",
