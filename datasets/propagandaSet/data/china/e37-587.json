    "Notes": "The Umbrella movement was a protest movement that swept through Hong Kong from late September to mid-December 2014, and that challenged the plans of the PRC central government to pre-screen the candidates for Hong Kong’s top government post. The popular name of the movement is derived from the practice of using umbrellas to shield protesters from pepper spray and water cannons.SourceBart Barendregt & Florian Schneider, \"Digital Activism in Asia: Good, Bad, and Banal Politics Online\", Asiascape: Digital Asia 7 (2020), 5-19",
