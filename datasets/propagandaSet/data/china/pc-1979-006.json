Guo's operas were considered bourgeois and not performed during the Cultural Revolution but re-staged afterward.Below left is a poem with the (translated) phrases \"I [Guo Moruo] am glad that the four demons have been eliminated and the four dramas have returned to reality. I am even more glad that the new Long March has begun and the grand plan of the four modernizations has begun.\" The four demons are the members of the Gang of Four, the four dramas are those written by Guo featuring the characters he is meeting in this picture, and the Four Modernizations campaign aimed to strengthen the fields of agriculture, industry, defense, and science and technology in China.A remarkable detail: Guo Moruo is pictured with the hearing aid he wore in his later years.",
