Johnson caricature indicates that American imperialism has violated the Geneva Accords of 1954 ending the First Indochina War. These Accords called for a cease-fire, a regrouping of forces along the 17th parallel, with the Communists to the north and the French to the south. After two years, general elections were to be held in both the North and the South, leading to the establishment of a single national government.The Mao quotation at the top reads \"All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful.\"",
