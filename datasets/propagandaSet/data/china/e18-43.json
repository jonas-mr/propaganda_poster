    "Notes": "Chen Daishan (陈岱山, 1948-1972) was born in Changchun, Jilin Province. After graduation from Changchun No. 11 Middle School in 1968, he was assigned to the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant.On 25 December 1971, Chen was working overtime. Suddenly, a bright flame flashed from the spray booth of the final assembly line. He immediately picked up two fire extinguishers and ran towards the fire. Suddenly, he discovered that the fire was spreading to dozens of paint buckets beside the spray booth. With smoke coming from the edges of his clothes and his trousers burning, he moved buckets of paint away. The seventh bucket exploded in his arms, hot paint spraying all over him, and he caught fire. He passed out in the arms of the workers who tried to extinguish the flames. Chen was seriously injured, with a burned area of more than 85%. Although the hospital tried to save him, he died of septic bacterial infection on 9 February 1972, at the age of 24.",
