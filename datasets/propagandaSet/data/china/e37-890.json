On 14 March 2010, the third session of the Eleventh National People's Congress passed the decision to amend the Electoral Law. The outstanding characteristics and main spirit of the amendment of the election law were the implementation that the electorate equally represents rural and urban residents, which better reflects the equality of all people, of all regions, and of all nationalities. The two legal texts shown are the Constitution and the amended Electoral Law.",
