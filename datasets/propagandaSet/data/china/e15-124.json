The Jilin publisher republished it as a poster in March 1974, renamed as \"Long live Chairman Mao\" (毛主席万岁). It was slightly edited (the character for Mao 毛 was cleared up) upon its republication in June 1974 with the People's Fine Arts Publishing House. The poster shown here is the export version, in English.Source:Lou Qijing (娄启倞), Nianhua de gushi [年画的故事, The Story of New Year pictures] (Beijing: Zhongguo minzu wenhua chubanshe, 2020)",
