This Deng-quotation is illustrated with a photograph of a flower arrangement. The full quotation, from a speech during Deng's 1992 Southern Tour:\"In the process of reform and opening up, we must be a little more courageous, and we must dare to experiment; we cannot be like women with bound feet. If it looks acceptable, we must courageously experiment, courageously charge - Deng Xiaoping\"",
