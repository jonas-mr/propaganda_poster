The Third Five Year Plan (1966-1970) was originally to start in 1963, but at that time the economy was too dislocated as a result of the failure of the Great Leap Forward and four poor harvests to permit any planned operations. Execution of the deferreded plan was disturbed by the Cultural Revolution.This is a print from the second edition (March 1966).",
