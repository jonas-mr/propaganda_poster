    "Notes": "Preliminary design for a poster that was not published - after the events of 4 June 1989, posters showing Hu and Zhao together with Deng were inadmissible. This design was shown to us in the late 1990s during a visit to a major poster publishing house. Together with two other preliminary designs, it was hidden under a carpet and brought out almost furtively - although we were allowed to take a photograph. See also DC-024 and DC-026.In the background: the characters 中国 (Zhongguo - China), Tian'anmen Gate, a 'huabiao', symbols of modernity and technological progress, and hands risen in jubilation.",
