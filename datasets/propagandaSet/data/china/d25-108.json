    "Notes": "A two-part series detailing the counterrevolutionary activities and \"crimes\" perpetrated by the Roman Catholic Mission in China before and after 1949. Both series are incomplete: the first part lacks the opening sheets; the second part lacks at least one sheet, and possibly more at the end.Due to this, it is impossible to indicate when the series were published, where, by whom, and for what specific purpose. The last evil deed discussed, at the end of part two, dates from July 1965, during the \"Four Clean Ups\" movement (四清运动). This suggests that the two series were published some time in the mid-1960s.The names of the foreign missionaries have been identified as far as possibile.Titled \"Evidence that the Holy See [the Vatican] incited Chinese Catholics to oppose the Communist Party and the People's Government\" (罗马教廷煽动中国天主教派反对共产党和人民政府的罪证), the top photograph shows a counter-revolutionary instruction from Rome, from 1949. The bottom photograph shows \"Precautions for administering the sacraments\" (施行圣事注意事项) from 1949/1950, excluding CCP members and sympathizers from receiving the sacraments.",
