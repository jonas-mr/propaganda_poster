Indeed, the Central Academy of Art and Design (whose artists collectively produced this image) were tasked with producing various images that could be used throughout the country for propagandistic purposes in this particular year. The academy provided many similar images for distribution through publications such as Yiding yao jiefang Taiwan xuanchuanhua cankao ziliao (Reference materials for propaganda posters for the liberation of Taiwan) (Beijing: Renmin meishu chubanshe, 1958).\"",
