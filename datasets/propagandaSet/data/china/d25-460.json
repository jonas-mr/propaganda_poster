    "Notes": "A set of safety production legal education wall charts was compiled and printed in 1987 to cooperate with the implementation of the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the National People's Congress Standing Committee and the State Council to overcome bureaucracy and strengthen safety production.Titled \"Random acts wounded or killed six people\" (乱干蛮干死伤六人), the poster tells how, in 1985, 30-year old Zhang X became head of a factory under China Petrol in the Northeast. He wanted to make his mark. When the factory started a production drive in 1986, Zhang neglected security and engaged in rash acts (welding where fire was prohibited), leading to a massive explosion, resulting in the death of two people, while wounding four others. Zhang was convicted. ",
