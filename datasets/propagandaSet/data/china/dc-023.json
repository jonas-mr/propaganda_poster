It was one of the last designs to come from the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House propaganda painting department, won a first prize at an important exhibition, was acquired for the permanent collection of the Shanghai Institute of Culture and History, but ... was never published. Apparently, the publisher did not receive advance orders from bookstores, and decided not to have the design printed.Sources:Shen Kuiyi, \"Publishing Posters Before the Cultural Revolution\", Modern Chinese Literature and Culture 12:2 (2000), 177-202Precious Memories Stored.
