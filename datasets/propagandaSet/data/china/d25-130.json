    "Notes": "A two-part series detailing the counterrevolutionary activities and \"crimes\" perpetrated by the Roman Catholic Mission in China before and after 1949. Both series are incomplete: the first part lacks the opening sheets; the second part lacks at least one sheet, and possibly more at the end.Due to this, it is impossible to indicate when the series were published, where, by whom, and for what specific purpose. The last evil deed discussed, at the end of part two, dates from July 1965, during the \"Four Clean Ups\" movement (四清运动). This suggests that the two series were published some time in the mid-1960s.The names of the foreign missionaries have been identified as far as possibile.Titled \"Evidence of the crimes of counterrevolutionary Li Zhixiu\" (反革命分子李志修的罪证), the top cartoon shows Li secretely listening to GMD radio transmissions and spreading rumours in 1962 that a GMD invasion is imminent. The cartoon below shows Li telling people that stealing from the collective is no crime.Li Zhixiu (no details known) was a priest active in Hebei Province. He was arrested for counterrevolutionary activities in April 1965.",
