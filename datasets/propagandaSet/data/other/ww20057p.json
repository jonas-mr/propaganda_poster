    "Audio Description": "An illustration of a Christmas tree over a glowing golden background is the central feature of this poster promoting war bonds. The green tree is shaped like a cone and it leans to right. Three red ornaments with red and green ribbons, and  over a dozen war bonds decorate the tree. At the top of the tree is a yellow star with two radiating halos emitting from it. The tree is in a red stand. Under the tree there are 11 Christmas packages of different sizes, most of them wrapped in white paper with red ribbons.  In large red letters in the upper left hand portion of the poster is the message: “Give War Bonds.” There is a large red star to the right of the words. At the bottom of the poster are the words “The present with a future.” The word “future” is in large red capital letters with a red star over it. \r\n",
