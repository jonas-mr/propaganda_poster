    "Audio Description": "An American GI being killed in action is the central focus of this World War II poster with the message that reads “Careless talk got there first.” The soldier in a camouflage combat uniform and helmet is falling in mid-charge on a South Pacific battlefield. One hand is covering his face which has red blood streaming from it. His other hand is holding his stomach. The solider has just let go of his rifle, and it is falling to the sandy ground. In the background there are two soldiers crouching behind a palm tree, swaying in a strong breeze. The sky behind the soldiers is dark and smoky with streaks of yellow and orange along the horizon. In large yellow block letters at the top of the poster are the words: “Careless Talk.” Beneath those words are written in white letters are the words: “Got there first.”\r\n",
