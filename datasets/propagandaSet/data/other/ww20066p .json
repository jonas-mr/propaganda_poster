    "Audio Description": "On a white background the large black and white figure of a man with his left arm in a white sling frowns at the viewer. He is wearing a soft dark hat with a brim, a light color shirt with one buttoned pocket and dark pants. Pinned just above the shirt pocket is a round button with a drawing of a man’s face and upper body. The writing around the circumference of the button is not legible. To the right of the man’s image, in large red letters, are the words “Take care!” and below that in smaller black letters are the words “Idle hands work for Hitler.”\r\n",
