    "Audio Description": "Giving war bonds for Christmas is the subject of this World War II poster. At the top of the poster in red and green letters is the message “For Liberty and Peace on Earth” and on the bottom of the poster over a red background are the words printed in white letters that read: “Give War Bonds.” The illustration on the poster over a red background depicts bells hanging from green holly leaves with red berries. The two bells on the right of the swag of holly are made of red paper. The bell on the left is the golden brass Liberty Bell with its trademark crack, hanging from a wooden bracket. Below the bells is a $100 Series E war bond. In the upper left hand corner of the bond is a black and white portrait of President Grover Cleveland.  Typed on the bond are the names of its holders who are “Mr. And Mrs. America, Everywhere USA.” \r\n",
