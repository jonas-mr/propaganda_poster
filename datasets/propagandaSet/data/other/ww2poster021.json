    "Audio Description": "A soldier helping a wounded comrade during a raging battle is depicted in this black and white illustration. In the center of the poster is a solder with a broad brimmed helmet and rifle slung over his left shoulder. The fire of combat illuminates him, causing him to squint his eyes and grit his teeth. The soldier is leaning to his right as he is lifting up another soldier from the ground. The wounded soldier’s helmet has fallen off his head and his dark hair is mussed and sweaty. His eyes are staring at the ground. The sleeves of both soldiers’ shirts are rolled up. Behind them, the white burst of an explosion lights up a night sky. Superimposed over the scene above the soldiers in yellow type are the words: “Give ‘em the stuff to fight with…”   \r\n",
