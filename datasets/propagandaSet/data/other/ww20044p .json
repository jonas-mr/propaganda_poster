    "Audio Description": "This informative little poster about conservation features red and black text on a white background. The text at the top of the poster says “Serve our fighting men abroad, conserve these services at home. Electricity: turn off the lights and home appliances when not needed. Communications: don’t make unnecessary long distance phone calls. Water: repair leaky faucets, don’t let water run needlessly. Transportation: war traffic comes first travel only when you must.” A line drawing of a light bulb, a telephone, a running faucet and a train engine highlight the list. An red eagle perches on the top right corner of a red band at the bottom of the poster in which white italic text says “Saving these services frees fuel, manpower, material and equipment for war.”\r\n",
