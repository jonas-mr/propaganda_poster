    "Audio Description": "Recruiting women into the United States Marine Corps Reserve to do military support duties is the thrust of this World War Two poster. A dull green silhouette of a profile of young woman wearing a marine hat with a bill on a white background dominates the white background. Superimposed over the woman’s profile in red capital letters are the words: “Be a Marine.” Underneath that message in white capital letters are the words “Free a Marine” with a white line leading to the image of the Marine Corp logo is at  the woman’s neck. Under the woman’s chin in red letters are the words: “To fight.”  The Marine Corp logo is printed in black and white with an American bald eagle. The eagle’s wings are spread and its head is facing towards the left as it is perched on a globe with an anchor behind it. Underneath the profile is the word “Join” printed in red with the words “U.S. Marine Corps Women’s Reserve” printed in the same dull green as the profile. ",
