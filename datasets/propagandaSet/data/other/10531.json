    "Text:": " Roman Communists! Khrushchev has fallen, Stalin is vindicated – Long live the glorious comrade Stalin!Year  1964.Publisher  NA.Artist  NA.Additional information  Poster displayed in Rome, 1964, celebrating Khrushchev’s downfall. The poster is signed ‘I compagni cinesi’, or ‘The Chinese Comrades’. Khrushchev was removed from power during a plot arranged by his successor Leonid Brezhnev and other co-conspirators. Many communist parties and leaders, most notably Mao and the Communist Party of China, had previously condemned Khrushchev as a revisionist. The poster seems to have been produced as part of a government and right-wing disinformation campaign named ‘Operazione manifesti cinesi’, or Operation Chinese Posters, to divide Italian communists."
