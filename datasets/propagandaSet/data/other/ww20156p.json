    "Audio Description": "On a dark green and black background a grim-faced, square-jawed soldier turns his head to look sternly out at the viewer in this poster about national security. He is dressed in a brown jacket, open at the neck and a helmet with the chinstraps hanging freely on either side of his face. His strong left hand grips a rifle with a bayonet. A light coming from the right of the picture highlights his hand and his face. In a black band at the top of the poster are the words “The battle-wise infantryman…” in white letters. At the bottom a red band with white letters says “is careful of what he says or writes, how about you?”\r\n",
