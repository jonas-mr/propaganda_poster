    "Audio Description": "The viewer of this poster of a sailor is encouraged to donate to the Red Cross during the Second World War. The image on the poster is the illustration of a serious young man at sea posed against a gray sky.  He is wearing a white naval cap, and a gray life jacket over a blue shirt. Two fingers on his left hand holding black binoculars are visible in the lower left hand corner of the poster. To the right of the sailor is green sea with white-capped waves on the horizon. Above the sailor printed in white letters are the words: “Keep your Red Cross at his side,” and superimposed over on his left side is a large red cross with a thin white border. To the left of the Red Cross and over his shoulders and chest is the word: “Give.”\r\n",
