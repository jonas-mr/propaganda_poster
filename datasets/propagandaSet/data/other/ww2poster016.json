It features a black and white photograph of a black Ethiopian soldier facing toward the right, blowing a bugle.  He is wearing a cap with a brim and his uniform has a high collar and brass buttons on the shoulder and cuffs. Above him a blue band with white letters proclaims, “This man is your friend”. To the right of the soldier is a box with a blue border containing the word “Ethiopian” in black letters. Below the soldier is another blue band with the words “He fights for freedom” in white letters. Centered underneath this are three small white stars.\r\n",
