    "Audio Description": "On a dark blue background that fades to light blue toward the bottom of the picture, stand a man and a woman looking toward the viewer. They are both wearing dark blue bib overalls and white long-sleeved shirts with the sleeves rolled up. The man is wearing a straw-colored hat with a black band and is holding a pitchfork in his right hand. The brown-haired woman is wearing tan gloves and is carrying a woven wicker basket in her left hand. Spilling from the basket are lettuce, a head of cauliflower, a tomato and two beets. Above the figures, in white letters are the words “Work on a farm this summer”. Below them, in a black band in white letters, are the words “Join the U.S. Crop Corps, see your U.S. employment service or your local county agent.”\r\n",
