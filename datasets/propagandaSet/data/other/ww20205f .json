    "Audio Description": "This simple black and white poster about rationing and price control depicts two figures. At the top right stands a figure with a round read and hands behind its back wearing a black shirt and pants, covered by a long white apron. Above the head of this figure is the American flag. At the lower left is another figure with a round head, dressed the same but pointing a pistol to its left. This figure has an empty rectangle above its head. The text of this poster says, “Most Americans comply with rationing and price control but the violator steals your share, your money, cheats honest merchants. Report him to your local board.”\r\n",
