    "Text: ": " England’s Vietnam.Year  1977.Publisher  NA.Artist  NA.Additional information  The album cover features an image borrowed from a famous Republican poster promoting the Belfast Brigade, suggesting that The Troubles in Northern Ireland would be to Britain what the Vietnam War was to the US. The record is a compilation of folk songs performed by ‘The Men of No Property’, a group of anonymous, Belfast-based songwriters known for their Republican sympathies. Their name is derived from a quote attributed to 18th-century Republican Wolfe Tone, emphasizing the support of the disenfranchised class."
