    "Audio Description": "This poster about war bonds shows a soldier in battle preparing to throw a hand grenade. Behind him is some barbed wire and the sky is gray with black smoke curling up. The soldier is looking up to the right, away from the viewer and holds the black grenade in his muscular right hand. His left arm is stretched forward and his mouth is open. He is wearing a brown uniform, open at the neck, and a dark green helmet with chinstrap firmly in place. Above the soldier, in yellow letters are the word “Let ‘em have it.” Below him, in large white letters are the words “Buy Extra bonds.” Above the word “Buy” is a shield with white text on a red and blue background, that reads “We bought extra war bonds, 4th war loan.”\r\n",
