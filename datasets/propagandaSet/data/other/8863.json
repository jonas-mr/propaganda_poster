    "Additional Information": " Glas Pobede (The Voice of Victory) was a British and American-produced series of propaganda booklets from the Second World War. Publication began around the time that the British were shifting their support from the Chetniks to Tito’s partisans, with the booklets being distributed throughout Yugoslavia in the later years of the war. The publication went through several issues before ceasing publication with the end of the war. Second image is from the following issue and shows Churchill and Tito at an August 1944 summit in Naples, Italy, illustrating an article celebrating Tito’s leadership of the partisans, declaring  ‘What Yugoslavia achieved in this war in military terms has no equal in history’."
