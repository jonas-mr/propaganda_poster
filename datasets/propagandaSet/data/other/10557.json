    "Text: ": " Ireland – Our Cuba?Year  1970.Publisher  The Monday Club.Author  Jeremy Harwood, Jonathan Guinness, John Biggs-Davison.Additional information  British Conservative pamphlet published at the start of the Troubles (1970) warning of the danger of Ireland becoming a communist outpost. The pamphlet was issued by the Monday Club, a Conservative think tank founded in 1961 to counter the alleged leftward shift in British politics. Authored by writer Jeremy Harwood, the British peer Jonathan Guinness, and the Conservative MP John Biggs-Davison, the pamphlet argues that communist intelligence agencies had significant ties with the Republican Movement, both of which, in Big-Davison’s words, were in the process of ‘breaking through sectarian barriers to form an all-Ireland class war and socialist revolution’ (as quoted in a later 1972 tract, ‘The Strategic Implications for the West of the International Links of the IRA in Ireland’)."
