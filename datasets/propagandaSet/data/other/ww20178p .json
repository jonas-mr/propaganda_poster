    "Audio Description": "At the center of this poster about buying war bonds is a soldier in combat gear. He is wearing a close-fitting brown leather helmet, goggles with green lenses, an orange life vest, brown uniform with rolled up sleeves, and brown leather gloves. His hands are gripping the controls of an anti-aircraft gun. Behind him, on the pale blue background, is an airplane in a nosedive, trailing a plume of black smoke. Above his head are the words “You can’t afford to miss either!”. Below him is a strip of blue with the words “Buy bonds every payday”, in large white letters.\r\n",
