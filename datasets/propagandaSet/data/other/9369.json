    "Additional Information": " American billboard in Alabama, 1965, claiming to show Martin Luther King at a ‘Communist Training School’. The photo was taken in 1957 and shows King at a workshop at Tennessee’s Highlander Folk School, which was founded in 1932 and had, by the 1960s, gained a reputation as centre for left-wing organisation and civil rights activism. Right-wing groups claimed the school was a hotbed of communism and ‘racial agitation’ and displayed the photo of King on billboards during the Selma-Montgomery marches in an attempt to discredit him. These particular billboards were sponsored by the John Birch Society."
