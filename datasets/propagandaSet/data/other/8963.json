    "Artist:": " Ionac.",
    "Additional information:": " This poster was part of a series of recruitment posters issued by the Rhodesian Security Forces during the Bush War. The phrase “Terrorism stops here” was a common slogan used in these posters. The RSF’s coat of arms appears at the bottom right with additional text reading  “Support the legal government of Rhodesia in their struggle against communism”. This particular poster was likely produced for international distribution, particularly among mercenary recruiters who successfully drew thousands of mercenaries from abroad to fight in the RSF during the war. The design of the poster is presumably based off the much more famous “Be a man among men” poster."
