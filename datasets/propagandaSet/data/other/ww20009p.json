    "Audio Description": "A catastrophe at sea is illustrated in this World War Two poster entitled “A careless word…a needless sinking.” In the background of the poster is a burning supply ship that has been either bombed or torpedoed on the high sea. Orange flames and black smoke bellow from the hull of the stricken vessel. The sea itself is ablaze as burning oil spreads across the water from the sinking ship. The fire is reflected in yellows and orange on the black ocean swells. Dominating the right hand forefront of the poster is a crowded lifeboat. An officer is standing in the boat, watching the ship burn as sailors row away from the disaster. An exhausted sailor sits at the edge of the boat, hunched over with his shirt torn, exposing his bare back. Lying down beside him is a wounded sailor, his shirt open and his eyes closed. \r\n",
