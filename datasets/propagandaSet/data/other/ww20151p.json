    "Audio Description": "This poster reminds Americans the importance of ordering coal before winter. The image on the poster is a charcoal drawing of the corner of a cellar. Leaning against the right wall is a shovel. A few lumps of coal around lay on the floor of the cellar near the scoop of the shovel. The bottom of a window is showing on the left wall. Spelled out on the floor of the cellar in pieces of coal are the words “Too little, too late.” Red bands appear at the top and the bottom of the poster. In white cursive letters at the top of the poster are the words: “Don’t let this happen to you.” In large white capital letters at the bottom of the poster are the words “Order Coal Now!” In black print at the very bottom of the poster are the words “Solid Fuels Administration for War.”  ",
