    "Audio Description": "The towering hooded figure of a man demands the attention of the viewer. Dressed in a black suit with a bit of his white shirt showing, he is positioned against two red brick walls that meet in a corner behind his left shoulder. A bit of blue-black sky is visible above the walls that loom menacingly over the man. The tan hood covers his face entirely, his wrists are each chained to something outside the frame of the picture, and his hands are curled into fists. Superimposed on his torso are red letters that say, “This is Nazi brutality.” Below them in yellow strips that imitate a telegram are these words in black letters:  “Radio Berlin, It is officially announced, all men of Lidice, Czechoslovakia, have been shot: the women deported to a concentration camp; the children sent to appropriate centers, the name of the village was immediately abolished. 6/11/42, 1:15 p”\r\n",
