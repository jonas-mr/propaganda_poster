    "Text": " Is it fair to force your baby to smoke cigarettes? ",
    "Year": " 1974.",
    "Publisher": " Health Education Council.",
    "Artist": " NA.",
    "Additional information": " Full text reads  ‘This is what happens if you smoke when you’re pregnant  Every time you inhale you fill your lungs with nicotine and carbon monoxide. Your blood carries these impurities through the umbilical cord and into your baby’s bloodstream. Smoking can restrict your baby’s normal growth inside the womb. It can make him underdeveloped and underweight at birth. Which, in turn, can make him vulnerable to illness in the first delicate weeks of his life. It can even kill him. In just one year, in Britain alone, over 1,500 babies might not have died if their mothers had given up smoking when they were pregnant. If you give up smoking when you’re pregnant your baby will be as healthy as if you’d never smoked.’"
