    "Audio Description": "Keeping quiet about troop movements is the message of this illustrated World War II poster. A confident young man in a crisp dark blue navy uniform with white trim and a white hat is shown walking with his gear over a white background. He is holding a large, bulging white canvas bag on his left shoulder. A rope is binding the contents of the bag in a manageable heap. The sailor is looking over his right shoulder, his white teeth showing in a flashing smile. His right arm and hand are swinging free. A red box appears at in the lower left hand of the poster over the lower portion of the sailor’s torso. The message appearing in white letters reads: “If you tell where he’s going…He may never get there!”\r\n",
