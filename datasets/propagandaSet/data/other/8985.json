    "Text:": " Have you really sold even your soul to those playing the part of a Liaozhai character?",
    "Year:": " 1941.",
    "Publisher:": " NA.",
    "Artist:": " NA.",
    "Additional information:": " This propaganda leaflet was printed for the Battle of Hong Kong, which was fought in December 1941 and ended in Japanese victory, and shows a British soldier-wolf leading an unsuspecting Chinese soldier off a cliff into Japanese bayonets. The text loosely translates to  ‘Have you really sold even your soul to those playing the part of a Liaozhai character?’ (The Liaozhai being a collection of classical Chinese ghost stories, the implication here being that the Brits are duplicitous demons leading the Chinese to their ruin)."
