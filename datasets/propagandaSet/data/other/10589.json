    "Text:": " Today, as yesterday, liberation or dependence – all together we will triumph.Year  1983.Publisher  Justicialist Party.Artist  NA.Additional information  The poster was published during the 1983 general election in Argentina by the Justicialist Party, founded by Juan and Eva Peron in 1946. It depicts Juan Peron tearing the word ‘dependence’, shaded with the American, British, and Soviet flags, symbolizing Argentina’s struggle for independence from foreign influence. The election marked Argentina’s return to democracy after seven years of military dictatorship following a 1976 coup. The Radical Civic Union won the election, defeating the Peronists. Peronist propaganda often portrayed the party as representing a third position against capitalism and communism."
