    "Audio Description": "In this poster about preventing forest fires three cartoon animals are shown standing in green grass. A tan and brown rabbit, a black and white skunk, and a tan and brown deer with antlers gaze at the viewer with wide-eyed, open-mouthed, surprised expressions. On a white background next to the deer (in brown letters) are the words “Please mister, don’t be careless”. In a green band at the bottom of this poster are large pale green letters that say “Prevent forest fires”, and below them, in smaller white letters “greater danger than ever",
