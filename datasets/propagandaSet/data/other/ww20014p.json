    "Audio Description": "Propaganda about the evil of the enemy is the thrust of this World War Two poster. The image on the poster is a hand of a Nazi savagely stabbing a dagger through a Bible. The top of the poster is black which bleeds into a red background. The arm and hand holding the dagger are darkly lit. On the sleeve of the hand holding the dagger is a red swastika. The steel blue dagger is a foot long and it is driven through the well-read book. The edges of the brown cover are turned down and are dog-eared. Inscribed in gold on the cover are the words “Holy Bible.” The cover is slightly opened and the shadow of the blade falls across the first white page of the book. There are streaks of gold leaf on the pages of the Bible. The point of the blade is sticking out about three inches from the bottom of the book.  A yellow ribbon bookmark hangs from the book at the same point where the shadow from the dagger falls. The trimmed edge of the bookmark rests upon a black strip at the bottom of the poster.  Printed in green capital letters in the strip are the words “This is the enemy.”",
