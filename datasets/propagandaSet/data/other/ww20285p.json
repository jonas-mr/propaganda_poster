    "Audio Description": " At the top of this poster, in large black block letters and red numbers is the text, “Over 1,250,000 tons of Axis shipping sunk in the Central Mediterranean.” The bottom portion of the poster is a map. The Mediterranean Sea is painted a pale blue with the land masses a gray-blue color. The countries of Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece, Albania, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Malta, and Crete are shown in their entirety, while only the coastlines of Libya and Tunisia are visible. Black letters superimposed over the landmass identify each country. Along the coastlines are small green, black, orange, and white images representing different types of ships that were sunk, damaged, or captured. A pale blue box in the upper right corner of the map contains a key to the types of ships represented, including cruisers, destroyers, warships and supply ships. The key also indicates that U-Boat losses are not shown.\r\n",
