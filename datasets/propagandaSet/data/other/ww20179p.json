    "Audio Description": "A happy little boy looks out from this poster about war bonds. He has rosy cheeks and short blonde hair. His mouth is open as if laughing and his teeth are showing. He is wearing a white short-sleeved T-shirt and red overalls. The boy is clasping the hands of a man below him who appears to be holding him up. The hands reach out of black sleeves and the cuffs of a white shirt are visible at the end of the sleeves. Against a yellow background, to the right of the boy in red letters are the words “Protect his future”. In a red band at the bottom in white letters are the words “Buy and keep war bonds.”\r\n",
