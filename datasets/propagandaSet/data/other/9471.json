Enemy air, land and sea forces have already suffered heavy reverses in the Leyte area. As our landings continue, it is essential that our bombers and fleet prepare the way. We do not want to injure a single Filipino. During the period from the 15th of December to the 8th of January follow these instructions carefully: – Stay away from the Japanese troops and any place where they are gathered together. Avoid all buildings, dumps, airstrips, and bridges used by the Japanese. And most important of all, at the first sign of our landing, move away from the beaches. Move inland as far as possible. For your own safety comply with this request.’"
