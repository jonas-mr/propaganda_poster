    "Audio Description": "This World War Two poster poignantly portrays the pangs of a needless loss of life. In a room with a bluish gray wall, a reddish brown-colored cocker spaniel has its muzzle resting on a collar of a naval middy blouse draped over the back of a blue upholstered. The middy collar is navy blue and trimmed with three white stripes all around. Resting inside the interior white stripes of the collar at both the right and left corners are white stars. The dog has large dark eyes, and its long ears are lying across the collar. Behind the dog hanging on the wall is a Service Flag. The flag is bordered red and the field in the middle is white. In the center of the flag is a gold star, signifying that a serviceman has been lost in combat. At the bottom of the poster in white, lower case letters are the words “…because somebody talked!”\r\n",
