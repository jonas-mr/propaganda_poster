    "Audio Description": "On a dark blue and black background are a red, a white, and a pale blue parachute. Attached to the red parachute is a tan wooden box. Behind this, the black figure of a soldier is hanging from the white parachute. Farthest back in the picture, the pale blue parachute appears to have nothing attached to it. Superimposed over the picture are the words “Where our men are fighting our food is fighting”, in white letters, with the word “Food” in stenciled black letters on the wooden box. Across the bottom of the poster, in orange letters are the words “Buy wisely, cook carefully, store carefully, use leftovers.”\r\n\r\n",
