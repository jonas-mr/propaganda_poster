    "Additional information": " Produced for the  for the Volunteer Force, established in 1934 by the then-governing party Fianna Fáil. The force was intended to attract the party’s young Republican supporters and provide military training to any young Irishmen who desired it. It was hoped that the Force would recruit up to 24,000 men, but between 1934 and 1939 it managed only 16,146, many of whom failed to re-enlist. During the Second World War many of the men of the former Volunteer Force worked for the Coast Watching Service, whose responsibilities included monitoring the coast for any military activity. The force was formally replaced by An Forsa Áituil in 1946."
