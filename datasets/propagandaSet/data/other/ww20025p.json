    "Audio Description": "This poster is about national security during World War II. A large rattlesnake is coiled in the center, on a white background, ready to strike at the viewer. It’s back has a diamond -shaped brown, yellow and white design. The snake is posed with its mouth open and blood dripping from its sharp white fangs into a small puddle below it. Wavy pale blue lines on either side of the snake’s rattle indicate movement. In large black letters above and below the snake are the words “Less dangerous than careless talk.” At the very bottom of the poster, in smaller black letters, are the words “Don’t discuss troop movements, ship sailings, war equipment.”\r\n",
