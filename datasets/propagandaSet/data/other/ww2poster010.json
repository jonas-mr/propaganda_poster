It features a black and white photograph of a Russian soldier facing toward the left, with a big smile on his face.  He has a metal helmet with a star and sickle insignia and carries a rifle over his left shoulder. Above him a blue band with white letters proclaims, “This man is your friend”. By his right shoulder is a box with a blue border containing the word “Russian” in black letters. Below the soldier is another blue band with the words “He fights for freedom” in white letters. Centered underneath this are three small white stars.",
