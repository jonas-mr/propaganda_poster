    "Audio Description": "This World War II poster features the illustration of a soldier encouraging more armament production on the home front. The smiling soldier is wearing a dark gray broad rimmed helmet that is strapped securely under his chin and a gray Army coat. The soldier is looking directly at the viewer. He is holding up his left hand with four fingers extended, and the index finger of his right land is touching the little finger of his left hand, as he is ticking off a list of armaments. The words tanks, planes, guns and ships are printed in red capital letters next to each extended finger. Above the soldier on a white background are the words printed in black that read: “Good News from Home.” Below the solider on a white background are the words printed in white capital letters that read “More production.”\r\n",
