    "Audio Description": "This black and white poster about war production has three drawings. At the top left of the poster Uncle Sam is shown putting on a workman’s cap with his traditional top hat sitting atop a silhouetted cityscape. In the center is a drawing of a shipyard with cranes lifting materials. To the right of this are a series of silhouetted drawings that show the creation of a warship. At the bottom right the prow of the destroyer is plowing through the waves toward the viewer. At the top of the poster are the words “Making America strong,” in white letters outlined in black. The rest of the poster reads, “How American shipyards are winning the race against time to build our navy. In normal times it took about 24 months to build a destroyer. Today they are being built in less than half that time!”\r\n",
