    "Audio Description": "This dramatic poster reminds citizens that sharing any military information could help the enemy sabotage the war effort. At the top of the poster, on the white background, in large black block letters is the word “Wanted!” Below is a black and white photograph of a young dark-haired woman with her hair pulled back from her face, wearing a white blouse and small round flat earrings. The woman directs her level gaze directly at the viewer with her lips pressed together in a very slight smile. The light shining from the right across her face highlights her knowing, self-satisfied expression. Beneath her picture, on the white background, in large black block letters are the words “For murder”. In smaller red letters below are the words” Her careless talk costs lives.”\r\n",
