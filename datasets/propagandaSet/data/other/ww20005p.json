    "Audio Description": "A blonde-haired woman with blue eyes looks out at the viewer in this poster about ration stamps. Her right hand is upraised, palm out, and she has a serious expression on her face. She is wearing a red and white striped short sleeve dress with an open collar and a white apron with a ruffled edge on the straps. The woman is positioned on a field of blue that has a line of pale blue stars that span the width of the poster. On the bottom half of the poster on a white background are the words “Make this pledge: I pay no more than top legal prices, I accept no rationed goods without giving up ration stamps,” in black letters. At the very bottom of the poster, below this text, is a red bar with a dark blue star at each end.\r\n",
