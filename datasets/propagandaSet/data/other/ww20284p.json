    "Audio Description": "A Royal Air Force Pilot is front and center in this poster urging confidentiality of wartime intelligence and armament production. Standing in front of a blue sky above a snowy white landscape is a young man wearing flight gear. The pilot has blonde hair and he is smiling, looking at the viewer. In his left hand he is holding an oxygen mask, and he is holding a parachute under his left arm. Wide safety straps crisscross his chest, and they are locked securely in a round, silver buckle. A tweed scarf hangs from the pilot’s neck. In an orange box with rounded corners in the lower portion of the poster in large black capital letters are the words: “Careless Talk May Cost His Life.” Just below those words in the orange box are smaller white letters is the message: “Don’t Talk About Aerodromes or Aircraft Factories.”\r\n",
