    "Audio Description": "In this somber reminder of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a tattered American flag flies at half-staff in a strong breeze. Behind it large clouds of black smoke are rolling up across and partially covering the light blue sky with its white clouds. Superimposed over this image, at the top of the poster, are the words “we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain,” in white italic letters. Superimposed over the bottom of the poster, in large red italic letters are the words “Remember December 7th!”",
