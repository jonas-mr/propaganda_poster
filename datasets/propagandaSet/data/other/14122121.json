    "Audio Description": "This poster offers simple health rules on how Americans at home can limit their doctor visits for serious illnesses and accidents since one-third of American doctors were in the armed forces.  The text on the poster is in white and black type on a blue background. The title of the poster appears on the top of the page and reads: “Just by keeping well you can help win this war.” The five health rules listed on the poster are 1) Eat right; 2) Get your rest; 3) See your doctor once a year; 4) Keep clean; and 5) Play some each day. Next to each of the tips is a black and white cartoon in a white circle that support the health tips. The cartoons are of a man sitting at a table eating; a man sleeping in a bed; a man being examined by a doctor; a man taking a bath; and two children playing baseball.\r\n",
