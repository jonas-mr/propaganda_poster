    "Text": " There is an alternative to commuting by rail. But could we live with it? Every working day, 400,000 people travel in and out of London by British Rail. But there is an alternative. Like Los Angeles, we could rely entirely on roads instead. Of course, some roads would have to be widened to take the extra traffic. Not only that, but we’d need to build an estimated 120 additional lanes of highway. Even then, there would still be the problem of what to do with all the cars as they converged on Central London. Looking at it that way, it makes a lot of sense to invest in our way. British Rail – The backbone of the nation.",
