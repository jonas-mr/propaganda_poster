    "Audio Description": "In the foreground of this yellow and black action-filled British poster a soldier is shown lunging forward with his bayonet ready to pierce the arm of a soldier on the ground. The soldier on the ground is defending himself with his own bayonet. Behind and around them are numerous other groups of combatants using rifles and bayonets. Underneath this picture, in small white letters on a white background are the words “An Indian lieutenant of the Baluch Regiment led a spirited charge to capture ammunition from a Japanese dump in the Marlaban area. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.” At the bottom of the poster, in large black block letters are the words “Smash Japanese aggression!”\r\n",
