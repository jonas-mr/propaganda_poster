    "Additional Information": " The phrase appears in election material throughout the 1960s and early 70s. The Republicans attempted – apparently unsuccessfully – to co-opt the phrase during the 1964 election, with Lyndon B. Johnson substituted for Nixon. The poster is mentioned in an article published in the Coronado Eagle and Journal on 21 July 1960  ‘Nixon’s picture also came into the scene, a picture of the Vice President at his grimmest over a caption asking, “Would you buy a used car from this man?”‘"
