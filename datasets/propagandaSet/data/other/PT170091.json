    "Description": "Design for a newspaper and magazine advertisement for a Liberty Loan campaign.  Text says that the wounded and the Red Cross working at hospitals have been the targets of the German shells. The Germans have made themselves lower than the beasts. Americans can stamp this beast down now, if they buy Liberty bonds with every cent they can spare. The illustration shows a hospital ship sinking; the ocean surrounding it is in the shape of the German military medal.",
