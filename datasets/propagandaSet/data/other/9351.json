    "Additional Information": " From a 1942 campaign launched after the company changed the packaging colour from green to white (the gist obviously being that the green previously used in the cigarette packaging is now being used for military equipment). Designer Raymond Loewy was commissioned for the purpose, tasked with designing a pack more attractive to women. The slogan generated a small controversy after Dan Golenpaul – host of Lucky Strike-sponsored radio show Information Please – complained that the slogan was ‘lousing up my program’."
