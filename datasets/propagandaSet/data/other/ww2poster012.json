    "Audio Description": "This poster was created to help United States soldiers recognize soldiers from other Allied countries during World War II. It features a black and white photograph of an Australian soldier with a big smile, facing the viewer.  He is wearing a wool uniform and his hat has a large brim with the left side curled up and a chinstrap keeping it in place. Above him a blue band with white letters proclaims, “This man is your friend”. To the left of the soldier is a box with a blue border containing the word “Australian” in black letters. Below the soldier is another blue band with the words “He fights for freedom” in white letters. Centered underneath this are three small white stars.\r\n",
