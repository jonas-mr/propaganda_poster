    "Additional Information": "The Advertising Council evolved out of the War Advertising Council that issued propaganda posters and other ephemera during the Second World War. During the early Cold War, the council embarked on a number of extensive campaigns to promote an ‘American way of life’ to the public and to counter the perceived threats of communism, racial division and general unrest. To that end, the council recruited a number of high-profile public figures and artists like Otto Soglow, the creator of this cartoon."
