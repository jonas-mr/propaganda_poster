    "Text:": " From the Dance Floor to HELL!Year  1946Publisher  NA.Artist  NA.Additional information  Written by Iowa-based preacher and writer James R. McMorrow, the pamphlet was one of a long tradition of evangelical anti-dance treatises (a list of some here) warning that dancing may lead to unchristian behaviour, or worse. As McMorrow himself writes of dances  ‘Fights are common! Drunkenness is on every hand. There is plenty of hot, jazzy music to excite passions and lust. Broken homes, homeless children, crowds of people who never go to church, plenty of terrible language … these are associated with the dance. Babies without fathers, opposite sexes so close together that you couldn’t crowd a thin piece of tissue paper between them’."
