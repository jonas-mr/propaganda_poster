The cartoon was drawn by Clifford K. Berryman and published in the Washington Star newspaper shortly after the Zimmermann Telegram scandal, when the British intercepted – and provided to the US – a telegram from German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmerman offering Mexico territory should it enter the war against the US. This cartoon was published 4 March, the day after Zimmerman acknowledged the telegram as genuine."
