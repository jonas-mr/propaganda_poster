It features a black and white photograph of a Dutch sailor with a cheerful expression facing the viewer.  He is wearing a dark, brimless cap and a dark uniform with a broad white collar and part of his striped shirt visible in the middle. Above him a blue band with white letters proclaims, “This man is your friend”. To the right of the sailor is a box with a blue border containing the words “Dutch Sailor” in black letters. Below the soldier is another blue band with the words “He fights for freedom” in white letters. Centered underneath this are three small white stars.\r\n",
