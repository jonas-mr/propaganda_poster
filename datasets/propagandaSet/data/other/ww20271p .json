    "Audio Description": "The black silhouettes of twenty-six bomber planes are shown over an aerial view of the orange and white glowing embers of a city in flames. They are arranged in squadrons with the planes decreasing in size the further they are from the viewer. Behind the planes rise the mountains, painted with abstract brushstrokes in shades of medium and pale blue with spots of white. Under the picture in small black letters are the words “Heavy bombers of the RAF often fly a total distance of 1,200 miles and over 15,000 foot mountains in the Alps to bomb the industrial towns of North Italy.” Below that in large black block letters are the words “The downfall of dictators is assured.”\r\n",
