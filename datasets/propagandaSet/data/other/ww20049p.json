    "Audio Description": "This ominous World War II poster reminds the viewer of the ever-presence of the enemy. The image on the poster is an illustration of a Nazi soldier peering over a wall. The top portion of the poster has a murky orange background with the rounded grayish black helmet of a German soldier emerging. A bolt is emerging from both the right and left side of the helmet in the vicinity of the soldier’s temple, giving him the aura of a monster. The soldier’s unblinking eyes and top of his nose is showing. The eyes are white slits with black dots. To the left of the soldier is a long black rod that gives the impression of a rifle. The wall the soldier is looking over is a dark purple under his eyes and becomes increasing black towards the bottom of the poster. In large white capital letters is the message of the poster: “He’s watching you.”\r\n",
