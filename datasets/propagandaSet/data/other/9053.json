The print shows Brother Jonathan straddling the towers of the main building of the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, with North America depicted behind him and two air balloons labelled ‘1776’ and ‘1876’ rising either side. The print was published by Currier & Ives – a New York-based publisher that regularly issued patriotic prints – to coincide with the Philadelphia Exposition, a six-month-long world’s fair celebrating the arts and industry of the United States. Flags of participating nations can also be seen flying along the exhibition building."
