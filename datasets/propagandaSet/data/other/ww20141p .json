    "Audio Description": "This poster about food conservation features large, colorful drawings of vegetables in the foreground. In the center is a green pea pod open to show six peas inside. Behind it are, clockwise, three orange carrots, two brown potatoes, a head of green cabbage,  three red radishes, two red tomatoes,  two green peppers, three white onions and two green string beans. The background of the poster depicts a man and a woman working in a garden, under a blue sky with one white cloud. The man, wearing dark blue overalls, a light blue short-sleeved shirt and a tan hat is pushing a tiller through rows of greenery. The red-haired woman is wearing a dark blue dress and is seated in another row pulling weeds. At the top of this poster in large black letters on a white background are the words “Your victory garden counts more than ever!”\r\n",
