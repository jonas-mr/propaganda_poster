    "Audio Description": "National security is the theme of the poster entitled “A careless word…a needless loss.” The image of the lifeless body of sailor washed upon a lonely shore is depicted within a thick black bordered. The broken body lying on the wet brown sand and white sea foam is clad in the black and gray-stripped uniform. The fallen seaman’s shirtsleeve is torn, as is the knee on his pants. The sailor’s complexion is ruddy and his wet brown hair is washed back as the dying daylight highlights his forehead. His eyes are closed. In the background the mounting white-capped waves roll shoreward, washing debris from the stricken ship that the sailor served on. Beyond the horizon, the sea is swallowing the great orange sun that is mostly obscured by gray clouds.  \r\n",
