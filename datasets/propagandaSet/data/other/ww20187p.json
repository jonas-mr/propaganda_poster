    "Audio Description": "On a background of pale yellow, this poster about rationing shows a caricature of the head and torso of a small, frowning, green man who is lying on his stomach with arms spread out, being squashed under a white and red ration stamp by a giant thumb. The soles of his shoes can be seen peeking out from the other side of the stamp. Large black letters read “Stamp out black markets”, and in light blue letters underneath the words, “with your ration stamps.” On a black band at the bottom of the poster are the words “pay no more than legal prices’” in yellow letters.\r\n",
