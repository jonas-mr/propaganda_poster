    "Audio Description": "In this poster about national security a grasping hand reaches up out of the swirling blue water as a white Navy cap floats nearby. Over this image in a white rectangle with edges that are drawn to appear torn are the words “don’t talk about ship movements! Don’t talk about war production!” in black letters. In white bands at the top and bottom of the poster large black letters proclaim “Somebody blabbed, button your lip!”\r\n",
