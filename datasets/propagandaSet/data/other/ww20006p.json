    "Audio Description": "On a white background is a black, gray and white drawing of a soldier wearing a helmet and carrying a rifle with a bayonet in his right hand. The soldier is walking toward the right side of the poster and his left arm is outstretched over his head as he looks back. The expression on his face catches him in mid-sentence as if he is saying the words printed in red above him: We have just begun to fight! In the lower right corner of the poster, in gray letters, is list of places where significant World War II battles were fought: Pearl Harbor, Bataan, Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, New Guinea, Bismarck Sea, Casablanca, Algiers, Tunisia.
