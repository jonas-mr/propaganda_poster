    "Audio Description": "This poster promoting fuel conservation is composed primarily of words. In a red background on the top portion of the poster in white large letters are the words “Fuel Fights” with the tagline in italicized black type reading “Save Your share.” In the middle of the poster are seven tips for energy conservation. The numbers are red and the tips are printed in black. They read as follows: “1) Keep temperature at 65 degrees Fahrenheit during the day --- lower at night; 2) Don’t heat unused rooms; 3) Keep windows closed; 4) Draw window shades at night; 5) Shut off heat when weather permits; 6) Keep heating plant in top conditions; 7) Use less hot water.” At the bottom of the poster is a band of black with white type that reads: “Saving fuel also saves manpower, material, equipment. Conserve coal, oil, gas…for war.” The only graphic on the poster appears on the bottom right hand side of the poster is a silhouette of an eagle carrying a banner in its beak that says: “Fight Waste.” \r\n",
