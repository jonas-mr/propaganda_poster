    "Audio Description": "This patriotic British poster depicts soldiers of the United Kingdom military forces. The men, shown from the waist up, are all facing right marching with rifles over their left shoulders. Each man is wearing the uniform of his country or branch of service. The men represent the Royal Canadian Air Force, the South African Army, the Australian Army, the New Zealand Army and the Royal Navy. The King’s African Rifles, Kenya, are represented by a black man and the Indian Army is represented by an Indian man in a turban, with a belt of rifle cartridges across his chest. The other men are white. Most of the men are in khaki colored uniforms with the exception of the Royal Canadian Air Force, which is gray-blue and the Royal Navy, which is navy blue. Behind the men on a pale blue background flutters the red, white and blue flag of Great Britain. On a black band at the bottom of the poster, in large yellow block letters is the word “Together”.\r\n",
