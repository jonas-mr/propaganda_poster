    "Audio Description": "In this poster about national security the outstretched hand of a fallen soldier is shown near the butt of his rifle, which is lying under a tangle of barbed wire. Swirls of black under the hand imply that the soldier is bleeding and downward moving streaks of gray near the rifle and the hand give a sense of movement to the images, as if the event has just this moment occurred.  Over this image in a white square with edges that are drawn to appear torn are the words “don’t talk about ship movements! don’t talk about war production!” in black letters. In white bands at the top and bottom of the poster large black letters proclaim, “Somebody blabbed, button your lip!”\r\n\r\n",
