The soldier is wearing an un-strapped helmet as the sky behind him is darkening from blue to black. His eyes are highlighted in a yellow light and his face is dirty from combat. The text of the poster is in composed of light green capital letters that stand out against the dark poster. The text that is printed above and below the face of the soldier poses the question: “Have you really tried to save gas by getting into a car club?”\r\n",
