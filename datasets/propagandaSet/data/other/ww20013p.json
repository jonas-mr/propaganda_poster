    "Audio Description": "At the top of this poster on a pale blue background are large white block letters that say, “United” Below is a battle scene with two gray naval destroyers and the gun turrets of a third visible in the water. Behind the ships, in front of a section of pale green sky are large black and gray rolling clouds of smoke coming up from the water. The front cloud is yellow changing to orange then red and finally black at the top, as if coming from a fire. In the midst of the clouds the colorful flags of each member of the United Nations is shown on a staff, unfurled and blowing backward in the wind. Flying over the front cloud are two lines of airplanes heading toward the right of the image. In a black bar at the bottom of the image are white letters that say, “The United Nations fight for freedom”.\r\n",
