    "Additional information:": " Anti-NATO poster published in Serbia (Yugoslavia) around the time of the NATO bombing campaign of 1999. The design shows a pile of skulls with the American flag at the top right, the image being borrowed from a famous 1871 painting by the Russian artist Vasily Vereshchagin titled ‘The Apotheosis of War’. The poster appears to have been both printed and also shared online, as was common during the Kosovo War."
