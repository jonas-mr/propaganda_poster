    "Audio Description": "This World War II poster encourages British workers on the home front to work hard and contribute a portion of their earnings to the war effort. The image on the poster with a white background is an illustration of a man holding a sledgehammer over his head. The viewer is looking up towards the laborer who has a black shirt and black hat. The sledgehammer, the man’s hands and face have a red tint. The man’s hands and the left side of his face have a blue tint. The handle of sledgehammer throws a black shadow across the right side of the man’s face. The pale blue text at the bottom of the poster is printed over the laborer’s black shirt, and reads: “Hit back with your savings.” The words “War Savings” is in large red capital letters.\r\n",
