It features a black and white photograph of an English soldier facing toward the left, smiling at the viewer.  He is wearing a metal helmet with a chinstrap and is carrying a large machine gun over his left shoulder. A wristwatch is on his left arm. Above him a blue band with white letters proclaims, “This man is your friend”. To the left of the soldier is a box with a blue border containing the word “Englishman” in black letters. Below the soldier is another blue band with the words “He fights for freedom” in white letters. Centered underneath this are three small white stars.\r\n",
