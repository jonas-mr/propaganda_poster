    "Audio Description": "A swarm of happy soldiers home on leave are shown pouring out of four train cars in this poster about rationing. The soldiers are all wearing brown uniforms with brown shirts and ties. Each has a brown cloth cap perched at a rakish tilt on his head. On a dark blue sky above the train cars are the words “Millions of troops are on the move…” in white letters. In a dark blue band at the bottom of the poster are the words “Is your trip necessary? Office of Defense Transportation.”",
