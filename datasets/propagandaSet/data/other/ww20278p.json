    "Audio Description": " A painting of a British commando raid on a German-held port is depicted in the poster issued by the British Government during World War Two. The attack is occurring at night with the silhouettes of four British soldiers are running down towards the port clutching their bayoneted guns. White and red fire erupts from explosions on the port as debris flies in the gray night sky. Reacting to raid are two German soldiers, whose dark black shadows are highlighted by the illumination of the blast. Lying on the ground between the shadows is the body of a soldier. Further down the port are two orange and white-hot fires burning from other explosions. Two pillars of black smoke rise above the scene, along with a third pillar of smoke from an explosion outside of the scene to the right. The smoke is rising about the mountains of the port on a Norwegian fjord. Beneath the painting in bold, black capital letters is the phrase: “BACK THEM UP!”\r\n",
