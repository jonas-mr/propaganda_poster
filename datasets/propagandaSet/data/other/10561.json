    "Text:": " Preparations for the 25th Battle of the Isonzo. New, tremendous guns are under construction in the Terni factory which can shoot a hundred kilometres. They were designed by Gabriele d’AnnunzioYear  11 October 1917Publisher  Die Muskete magazineArtist  Josef V. DivékyAdditional Information  Austrian illustration from the First World War mocking the Italians during the Isonzo Campaign. The illustration shows enormous shells being transported from factories across a river to a similarly colossal artillery gun. During the war, some twelve battles were fought between Italy and Austria-Hungary near the river Isonzo in northeastern Italy. The twelfth and final battle, the Battle of Caporetto, was fought a few weeks after this illustration was published and ended disastrously for Italy, with 300,000 casualties, the collapse of the Italian line and the loss of almost all territory gained since 1915, when Italy joined the war."
