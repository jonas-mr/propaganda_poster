    "Audio Description": "At the center of this touching poster about war bonds a smiling older woman with a wrinkled face and a tear falling from her left eye is shown embracing a reddish-blond haired soldier as she looks toward the viewer. Their heads are pressed together and her chin is resting on his right shoulder. Her right hand is resting on the collar and shoulder of his green jacket. The soldier, who has his back to the viewer, also wears a soft green cloth military cap with darker green piping. At the top of the poster are two stripes, one dark blue, the other a lighter blue. The words “Speed the day” are written in italic letters on the dark blue band. At the bottom of the poster are the same two bands in reverse order, the darker band on the bottom. Large white letters that say “7th war loan” are written on the dark blue band.\r\n",
