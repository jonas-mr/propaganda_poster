    "Audio Description": "Dominating this World War Two poster promoting food conservation and home canning is a large clear, empty jar. There is a white label on the jar with thin blue and red strips on the top and the bottom of the label. Printed in blue capital letters on the label are the words “Can all you can.” The jar is tilted towards the right and it is lying on a bed of green lettuce. Surrounding the jar are different fruits and vegetables. Strewn around the jar are --- clockwise from the top of the poster ---  two ears of corn with yellow kernels and green husks, two red tomatoes, an orange peach , three purple beets, a green pear and a red apple. Printed in white capital letters on a blue strip at the bottom of the poster are the words “It’s a real war job!”",
