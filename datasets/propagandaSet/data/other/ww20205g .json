    "Audio Description": "This black and white poster about rationing depicts two scenarios. The first is a line drawing of three women wearing gloves, the two women on the right are also wearing hats. Each woman is carrying a medium size bag with boxes that may be groceries. The black text by this image reads, “We want this.” Below this, the second scenario is a line drawing of the same three women. The woman on the right is now carrying a large bag full of boxes as the other two look on with sad expressions on their faces. The black text by this image reads, “Not this”. The bottom of the poster is a black rectangle with white letters that say “Rationing is a must until supply equals demand.”\r\n",
